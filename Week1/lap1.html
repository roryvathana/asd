    <h1>My First Heading</h1>
    <p>My first paragraph.The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration specifically identifies the document as HTML5 because it was introduced as part of the HTML5 specification.

This was important for making sure the browser rendered the document according to the correct version of the HTML standard. It also distinguished between "strict," "transitional," and "frameset" modes of the language.
		"é", "ä", or even the "€" symbol might break or show up as "�" if the wrong encoding is used.
		Here’s an example of a DOCTYPE for HTML4:</p>
